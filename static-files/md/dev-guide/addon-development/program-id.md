# The Program ID #

The Program ID is a unique identifier for your add-on and is used for a variety
of purposes. For example: [addons.mozilla.org](http://addons.mozilla.org) uses
it to distinguish between new add-ons and updates to existing add-ons, and the
[`simple-storage`](#module/addon-kit/simple-storage) module uses it to figure
out which stored data belongs to which add-on.

The program ID is the public part of a cryptographic key pair. When `cfx`
generates a program ID it actually generates a pair of related keys: one half
(the public key) is embedded in package.json as the program ID while the other
half (the private key) gets stored in a file in ~/.jetpack/keys.

When the XPI file is generated it is signed with the private key. Then the
browser, or some other tool, can use the public key to verify that the XPI file
was actually signed by the author.

The private key is very important! If you lose it, you will not be able to
upgrade your add-on: you'll have to create a new add-on ID, and your users will
have to manually uninstall the old one and install the new one. If somebody
else gets a copy of your private key, they will be able to write add-ons that
could impersonate and displace your own.

The add-on's private key needs to be available (in ~/.jetpack/keys/) on any
computer that you use to build that add-on. When you copy the add-on source
code to a new machine, you also need to copy the private key (`cfx xpi` will
remind you of this). The best idea is to just copy the whole ~/.jetpack
directory to a USB flash drive that you can carry with you. It is not stored
in your package source tree, so that you can show your code to somebody else
without also giving them the ability to create forged upgrades for your add-on.

If you start your add-on work by copying somebody else's source code, you'll
need to remove their Program ID from the package.json file before you can build
your own XPIs. Again, `cfx xpi` will remind you of this, and your options, when
you attempt to build an XPI from a package.json that references a private key
that you don't have in ~/.jetpack/keys/.
